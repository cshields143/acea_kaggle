AUSER

    Two subsystems: NORTH and SOUTH; NORTH partly influences SOUTH
    NORTH levels: SAL, PAG, CoS, DIEC
    SOUTH levels: LT2



DOGANELLA

    Kinda a aquifer, kinda a "well field fed by two u.g. aquifers" (is there a difference?)
    Upper stratum is a "water table" 30m thick
    Lower stratum is a semi-confined artesian aquifer 50m thick



LUCO

    U.g. aquifer, not fed by rivers or lakes; fed by "meteoric infiltration"
    Accessed through wells



PETRIGNANO

    Fed by 3 u.g. aquifers separated by low permeability septa
    "The water table can be considered groundwater" & is fed by Chiascio river



AMIATA

    Kinda a waterspring, kinda a aquifer
    Accessed through Ermicciolo, Arbure, Bugnano, & Galleria Alta springs
    Levels/volumes of springs influenced by:
        - pluviometry
        - sub-gradation
        - hydrometry
        - temperatures
        - drainage volumes



LUPA

    Located in Arrone area
    Used for drinking use



MADONNA DI CANNETO

    1,010m above sea level in Canneto valley
    "Does not consist of an aquifer"
    "Source" is supplied by "the water catchment area of the river Melfa"



ARNO

    Second largest river in peninsular Italy (by what metric?)
    Main waterway in Tuscany
    Relatively torrential regime due to surrounding soils (marl, impermeable clays)



BILANCINO

    Artificial lake in Mugello, Florence
    Max depth of 31m
    Surface area of 5km²



----------

    ** = "super important type of feature", "every dataset uses this"
     * = "also super important", "ALMOST every dataset uses this"
     + = "kinda important", "50/50 datasets use this"

 ** Rainfall: mm
  * Temperature: °C (AIR temperature)
  + Depth to Groundwater: m (groundwater level in "ground level", or m from "ground floor")
    Volume: m³ (amount of water taken from a drinking water treatment plant)
    Hydrometry: m (groundwater or river level) (any real difference with D2GW?)
    Flow Rate: DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WATERBODY TYPE
        Waterspring: l/s ("taken from the water spring")
        Lake: m³/s ("lake's flow rate" ???)
    Lake Level: m (any real difference from hydrometry?)
